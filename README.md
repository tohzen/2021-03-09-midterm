<img src='./motivation.gif' />

> Welcome to the Term 1 midterm exam. This test will begin at 10:40am (or earlier) and end at 3:00pm. **Please take a one hour break** from 1:00pm - 2:00pm to eat lunch, rest your brain, and come back to the exam with a fresh set of eyes.

## Tips

* You may use the internet to look up anything you want (string methods, array methods, etc.)
* If you're feeling stuck, skip it!
* This midterm is long and you are not expected to finish
* You can go in any order
* It's better to show a little work on each problem than a lot of work on one problem
* Relax and have fun!

## Problems

### Problem 1: `ageToAbilities`

Write a function, `ageToAbilities` that takes a person's age and returns a message of their abilities according to the table below:

```
┌──────────┬────────────────────────────────────┐
│ age      │ message                            │
├──────────┼────────────────────────────────────┤
│ under 16 │ 'You can't drive.'                 │
│ 16 to 17 │ 'You can drive but not vote.'      │
│ 18 to 24 │ 'You can vote but not rent a car.' │
│ 25 plus  │ 'You can do pretty much anything.' │
└──────────┴────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Examples**
```
ageToAbilities(10) => 'You can't drive.'
ageToAbilities(25) => 'You can do pretty much anything.'
```

---

### Problem 2: `oddIndices`

Write a function, `oddIndices`, that takes in an array of numbers and returns only the ones that are located at odd indices (indices is plural of index). Recall that the index of the first value in an array (or string) is 0.

**Examples**
```
oddIndices([0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10]) => [2, 6, 10]
oddIndices([1]) => []
oddIndices([100, 101, 102]) => [101]
```

---

### Problem 3: `numOddValues`

Write a function, `numOddValues`, that takes in an array of numbers and returns the quantity of odd values in that array.

**Examples**
```
numOddValues([0, 1, 2, 3]) => 2
numOddValues([5, 5, 5, 5]) => 4
numOddVlaues([]) => 0
```

---

### Problem 4: `averageStringLength`

Write a function, `averageStringLength`, that takes in an array of strings and returns the average length of the strings. An average is calculated by first summing X values, then dividing the sum by X.

**Examples**
```
averageStringLength(['oh', 'hello']) => 3.5
averageStringLength([]) => 0
averageStringLength(['a', 'pleasant', 'string']) => 5
```

---

### Problem 5: `firstPunctuationIndex`

Write a function, `firstPunctuationIndex`, that returns the index of the first appearance of a period, question mark, or exclamation mark in the given string. If none are found, return `-1`.

**Examples**
```
firstPunctuationIndex('wow! goodness me.') => 4
firstPunctuationIndex('I love taking tests?') => 19
firstPunctuationIndex('...hello?') => 0
firstPunctuationIndex('alright alright alright') => -1
```

---

### Problem 6: `getPlace`

Write a function, `getPlace`, that takes in two parameters, a **sorted** list of high scores (highest first, loweset last)
and a new `score`. The function should return a human readable string indicating which 
place the new score fits into the given list of high scores.

> Note 1: You are not required to insert `score` into the `highScores` array 

> Note 2: We will assume that the new score is not already in the high scores list
so that we don't have to handle ties

**Examples**
```
getPlace([60, 30, 10], 90)     => '1st place'
getPlace([60, 30, 10], 50)     => '2nd place'
getPlace([60, 30, 10], 5)      => '3rd place'
getPlace([500, 300, 200], 100) => '4th place'
```
